        <h2>What is Symbil?</h2>

        <p>Symbil is a dynamic online investment adviser platform that assesses the risk profile of an investor and recommends a risk-appropriate
            managed Ladenburg Fund.</p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2>Is this a “robo-advisor” like I’ve heard about?</h2>

        <p>The Symbil platform is an electronic “robo advisor” program whereby investors can access an online tool that guides them through a quick
            questionnaire and suggests an investment in one of the 5 Ladenburg mutual funds. You receive the benefit of investment professionals who
            actively manage your Fund once you make the purchase of the Fund. Symbil utilizes the trusted investment professionals of Ladenburg
            Thalmann Asset Management to manage your Fund, not an actual robot.</p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2>Who is managing my investments through Symbil?</h2>

        <p>Symbil is provided by Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. LTAM’s an SEC Registered Investment Advisory firm established in 1982.
            LTAM hasover $2 billion in assets under management and a dedicated staff of professionals with over 100 years of investment management
            experience. To learn more about us, please visit <a href="http://www.ltam.com">www.ltam.com</a></p>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <h2>My advisor recommended I use this – how is he/she involved?</h2>

        <p>Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management has long been a trusted source of asset management for the clients of thousands of independent
            financial advisors. Symbil is a simple way for advisors to provide a solution to clients through a short interactive online process. Your
            advisor who is a registered representative of an Affiliate of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, Inc. (LTAM) and the Affiliate may
            receive a referral fee for referring you to the Symbil Website.</p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2> What are the investments being recommended through Symbil?</h2>

        <p>Through Symbil you gain access to the Ladenburg Funds, 5 mutual funds actively managed by Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management with
            risk profiles ranging from conservative to aggressive. The funds each offer a complete and globally diversified asset allocation with exposure
            to a range of asset classes including equities, fixed income and alternative investments. The particular fund that is recommended to you is
            determined by the answers you provide in the Symbil online questionnaire and is based on your goals, objectives and risk profile. For more
            information on the funds go to<a href="http://www.ladenburgfunds.com"> www.ladenburgfunds.com</a></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2> How many investments will I see in my Symbil account?</h2>

        <p>Your account will be invested in 1 of the 5 Ladenburg mutual funds so you will only see 1 investment in your account. However, through this
            single mutual fund, you’ll receive a complete asset allocation through the fund’s underlying investments in equity, fixed income and
            alternative investment exchange traded funds (ETFs).</p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2> Will the asset allocations ever change in the fund I’m invested in? What about things like rebalancing? What does that mean? Do
            you do that?</h2>

        <p>The asset allocations in your portfolio will periodically change for tactical purposes. The underlying foundation of our investment philosophy is the construction of a globally diversified portfolio based on strategic asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation is a strategy that divides up a portfolio among major asset classes (equities, bonds, cash equivalents, and alternative investment vehicles) in proportions that are
            consistent with an investor's long-term financial goals and objectives, establishing a "base policy mix". This mix of assets is based on
            expected rates of return and risk for each asset class. The tactical overlay essentially helps us determine which areas to under or over-weight
            based on market conditions. We will recommend a portfolio change where we can either reduce the risk in the portfolio or potentially add a higher rate of return, given a certain level of risk. In general, tactical changes tend to occur 2-6 times per year and are based on current market conditions.
            Any changes that we make we will rebalance our Funds according to current market conditions, but maintain our original foundation that
            accounts for the combination of risk and time.</p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2> Who can open an account through Symbil?</h2>

        <p>Anyone who is 18 years old or older, holds a permanent U.S. address and is a legal U.S. resident or U.S. citizen.</p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2> Is there a minimum amount required to invest?</h2>

        <p>Through Symbil, the minimum investment in the Ladenburg Funds is $500 as an initial investment.</p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2> What types of accounts does Symbil support?</h2>

        <p>Symbil currently supports Individual, Joint, Traditional IRA and Roth IRA accounts.</p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2> What do you charge? What types of fees can I expect?</h2>

        <p>There is no fee for Symbil through the process to determine the advice of the recommended fund. Once you decide to purchase the fund,
            there are certain expenses and fees that are internal to the Ladenburg mutual funds. LTAM, as the manager of the Funds, receives 0.50%
            annually, on the assets managed in the Ladenburg Funds for their active portfolio management within the Funds. This fee and certain other
            expenses mentioned above are taken from the fund before any performance is reported. We believe that our portfolios balance cost-
            effectiveness and performance with access to top investment management professionals. For information about all the fees and expenses
            associated with the Ladenburg Funds, please refer to the Funds’ prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-877-803-6583 or by visiting
            <a href="http://www.ladenburgfunds.com"> www.ladenburgfunds.com</a></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2> Is there an option for an Automatic Investment Plan?</h2>

        <p>Yes, the automatic investment plan allows you to make automatic monthly or quarterly investments in your account through a withdrawal
            from the bank account that you provide on the account application form. The minimum for the automatic investment plan is $50. </p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h2> What is the next step after creating an account?</h2>

        <p>You will be referred to an online investor portal held at our partners at Gemini Fund Company, who are the Fund Administrators and
            Shareholder Services for the Ladenburg Funds. From their secure portal you will be able to review your account’s performance, make
            updates or changes, and add more funds at your discretion.
        </p>
