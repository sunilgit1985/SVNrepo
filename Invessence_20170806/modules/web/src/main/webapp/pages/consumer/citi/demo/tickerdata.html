<p><b>GLOSSARY</b></p>
<p><b>Total Expense Ratio (TER):</b> A measure of the total costs associated with managing and operating a fund. The TER consists primarily of the
    management fee plus other expenses such as trustee, custody, or operating expenses. It is expressed as a percentage of the fund's total net asset
    value.</p>
<p><b>Distribution yield:</b> The distribution yield represents the ratio of distributed income over the last 12 months to the fund's current Net
    Asset Value.</p>
<p><b>Product Structure:</b> Indicates whether the fund buys the actual underlying securities in the index (i.e. Physical) or whether the fund gains
    exposure to those securities by buying derivatives, such as swaps (known as 'Synthetic'). Swaps are a form of contract that promises to provide
    the return of the security to the fund, but the fund does not hold the actual security. This can introduce a risk that the counterparty defaults
    on the "promise" or contract.<b>Methodology:</b> Indicates whether the product is holding all index securities in the same weight as the index
    (replicating) or whether an optimised subset of index securities is used (optimised/ sampled) in order to efficiently track index performance.
